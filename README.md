# 🌍 Translate the Sentence 💬

In the project, I performed language translation between different languages using the My Memory API 🌐💡. 
Additionally, by clicking on the speech button, which activates the Web Speech API 🎙️🗣️
We can listen to the input sentence and its translated version.

The languages I utilized in this endeavor were:

- **HTML 🌐**
- **CSS 🎨**
- **JavaScript 🖥️**

To enhance the user interface, I incorporated soothing pastel tones 🌈. 
I firmly believe that this translation feature will instill a sense of tranquility and seamless experience on the website✨.
